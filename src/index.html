                Tailwind CSS is a popular and <span class="italic font-bold text-blue-500">powerful CSS
                framework </span>that provides a set of pre-defined CSS classes
                that can be used to quickly and easily style HTML elements. The
                framework is designed to be highly customizable, allowing developers
                to easily create custom styles and layouts
                without having to write CSS from scratch.

            <p class="my-4 mx-auto w-4/5">
                One of the key benefits of Tailwind CSS is that it promotes
                consistency in design by providing a set of pre-defined classes that
                can be used across an entire website or application. This helps to
                ensure that all elements are styled consistently, which can make it
                <span class="font-bold"> easier to maintain and update the design over time.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="my-4 mx-auto w-4/5">
                Examples of such utility classes includes the
                <span class="font-bold">"text-center"</span> class can be used to center align text,
                while the <span class="font-bold">"bg-gray-200"</span> class can be used to add a light
                gray background color to an element.
            </p>
            <p class="h-20 mx-auto w-4/5 bg-gradient-to-t from-blue-500 to-green-400">
                Overall, Tailwind CSS is a great choice for developers looking for a
                powerful and customizable CSS framework that promotes consistency in
                design and makes it easy to create responsive designs.
                <span class="font-bold text-yellow-300">It's popular among frontend developers</span>
                and highly recommended for anyone looking to add more structure to
                their frontend development process.
